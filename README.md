# Classification of Gastrointestinal Abnormalities



## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of gastrointestinal abnormalities, particularly in predicting gastric cancer at early stages using the GastroNet algorithm. Gastrointestinal abnormalities, including gastric cancer, are serious health conditions that require early detection for effective treatment. By leveraging deep learning techniques and artificial intelligence, this project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of gastric cancer diagnosis.

## About GastroNet

GastroNet is a deep learning model specifically designed for detecting gastrointestinal abnormalities, including gastric cancer, from gastrosxopic images. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze images of the stomach lining and accurately classify regions with abnormalities.

## About MakeSense AI Tool

MakeSense AI is an advanced tool for medical image analysis. It provides a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to upload, process, and analyze medical images efficiently. With its integration of cutting-edge AI algorithms like GastroNet, MakeSense AI enhances diagnostic capabilities and improves patient outcomes.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload gastrosxopic images for analysis.
- **Abnormality Classification**: GastroNet algorithm analyzes the images to classify regions with gastrointestinal abnormalities, including gastric cancer, into categories such as normal, stage 1, and stage 2.
- **Diagnostic Reports**: MakeSense AI generates diagnostic reports based on the analysis results, providing insights and recommendations for healthcare professionals.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image**:
   - Navigate to the MakeSense AI platform.
   - Click on the "Upload Image" button and select the gastrosxopic image to be analyzed.

2. **Run Analysis**:
   - After uploading the image, click on the "Run Analysis" button to start the analysis process.
   - GastroNet algorithm analyzes the image to classify regions with gastrointestinal abnormalities.

3. **View Diagnostic Report**:
   - Once the analysis is complete, the diagnostic report will be generated.
   - The report includes information on the presence and stage of gastrointestinal abnormalities.
